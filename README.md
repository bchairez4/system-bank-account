# system-bank-account

Created by Brian Chairez

This C++ project implements a bank account system.

This system acts as a traditional bank account system while also acting as an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) in the sense that, upon signing in, a User is able to withdrawl and deposit funds from their account on top of the functionality a traditional bank account system would offer.

Functionality wise, a User must either sign in or sign up before proceeding to the main interface.
The main interface consists of all the options a User can select in order to manage their account to their discretion.
Users are stored in a local faux database as a text file that gets generated and/or updated by driver code when needed.
