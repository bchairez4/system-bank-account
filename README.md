# system-bank-account

Created by Brian Chairez

This C++ project implements a bank account system.

The bank account system functions similarly to a traditional bank account system while also acting as an ATM (Automated Teller Machine). The way it works is a User first signs in and is then able to withdrawl or deposit funds from and to their accounts on top of being able to open and close accounts as well as update their profile.

Functionality wise, a User must either sign in or sign up before proceeding to the main interface.
The main interface consists of all the options a User can select in order to manage their account to their discretion.
An Admin sign in is provided that contains high privilege functionality compared to a normal User.
Users and Admin are stored in a local faux database as a text file that gets generated and/or updated by driver code when needed.
