# system-bank-account

Created by Brian Chairez

This C++ project implements a bank account system.

The bank account system functions similarly to a traditional bank account system while also acting as an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) in which a user signs in to their respective account and is able to manage their profile, accounts, and available funds. 
The user has the ability to sign up if they do not already exist within the system's database. 
Signing up will ask for basic user information including an email and password and automatically create an empty checking account. 
After signing in, the user can edit account names, add/remove accounts, edit their user profile and/ or deposit/withdrawl 'money'. 

An admin sign in is included with elevated privileges giving the admin the ability to directly modify the user database.
